===================

awesomeWM 3.5 config and related files.

This is another awesome window manager 3.5.  This code is 
hacked together mainly from the wiki and other wonderful
sites to be named soon.  I guess some screenshots would 
be nice (also comming soon).

Please use this I am a shade tree programmer and would 
love to learn more.

The first question I have for you. Then some more.

1.  Is there a method to wrap the CPU graphs to clean 
     up the code?
2.  I would like to get keydoc from http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Document_keybindings to work, any
     ideas?
3.  What?

Notes:
  The icons have been omitted but have been left in the code.
  luafilesystem is now needed for auto-starting unless already running.
    
Creits 
  Heavily inspired form this source http://dotshare.it/dots/505/0/raw/ and 
  The awesome wiki.
