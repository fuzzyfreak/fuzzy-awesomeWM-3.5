===================

awesomeWM 3.5 config and related files.

This is another awesome window manager 3.5.  This code is 
hacked together mainly from the wiki and other wonderful
sites to be named soon.  I guess some screenshots would 
be nice (also comming soon).

Please use this I am a shade tree programmer and would 
love to learn more.

The first question I have for you.

1.  Is there a method to wrap the CPU graphs to clean 
     up the code?
